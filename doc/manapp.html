<b>NAME</b>
       vs2drti - A graphical software package for simulating water flow and
               heat and reactive solute transport in variably saturated porous
               media

<b>ABSTRACT</b>
       VS2DRTI is a graphical software package for simulating flow and
       transport in variably saturated porous media.  This software package
       consists of two components:

        - VS2DRTI, for simulating water flow and heat and reactive solute transport,
        - a standalone postprocessor, for viewing results saved from
          previous simulation runs.

       VS2DRTI combines a graphical user interface with a
       numerical model (VS2DRT) to create an integrated, window-based modeling
       environment.  Users can easily specify or change the model domain,
       hydraulic and transport properties, initial and boundary conditions,
       grid spacing, and other model parameters.  Simulation results can be
       displayed as contours of pressure head, moisture content,
       saturation, concentration or temperature, and velocity or flux for
       each time step, thus creating a simple animation.

       VS2DRT links the U.S. Geological Survey's computer models VS2DT (for solute
       transport), VS2DH (for energy transport), and Phreegc (for geochemical
       reactions).  VS2DRT is a finite-difference model that solves Richard's
       equation for fluid flow, and the advection-dispersion equation for heat
       solute transport.  The model can analyze problems in one or two dimensions
       using either cartesian or radial coordinate systems.  Relations between
       pressure head, moisture content, and relative hydraulic conductivity may be
       represented by functions developed by van Genuchten, Brooks and
       Corey, Haverkamp and others, or by data points.  Initial hydraulic
       condition can be specified as static equilibrium, specified pressure
       head, or specified moisture content.  Boundary conditions include
       specified pressure or total head, specified flux, infiltration with
       ponding, evaporation, plant transpiration, and seepage faces.
       Solute transport processes include advection and dispersion, as well
       as a complete implementation of the chemical reactions available in
       Phreeqc.

       VS2DRT is written in Fortran 90 and C++.

       A Windows executable version of VS2DRT (vs2drt.exe) is included in the
       download package for user who would prefer to run simulation in
       batch mode.

<b>METHOD</b>
       For the flow equation, spatial derivatives are approximated by
       central differences written about grid-block boundaries.  Time
       derivatives are approximated by a fully implicit backward scheme.
       Nonlinear conductance terms, boundary conditions, and sink terms are
       linearized implicitly.  Relative hydraulic conductivity is evaluated
       at cell boundaries by using full upstream weighting, the arithmetic
       mean, or the geometric mean of values from adjacent cells.
       Saturated hydraulic conductivities are evaluated at cell boundaries
       by using distance-weighted harmonic means.  Nonlinear conductance
       and storage terms can be represented by algebraic equations or by
       tabular data.

       For the advection-dispersion equation, either central or backward
       differences may be selected for the spatial and time derivatives.
       Thermal conductivity is assumed to vary linearly with moisture content.
       The matrix equations produced for the flow and transport equations are
       solved sequentially using the strongly implicit procedure.

       An operator-splitting approach is used in VS2DRT, whereby the flow
       and transport equations are solved independently of the geochemical
       reactions. At each time step, the flow, heat, and solute transport
       equations are solved, allowing simulated concentrations to be transported
       by advection and dispersion. Component concentrations for each model cell
       are then transferred to PhreeqcRM; geochemical reactions are simulated;
       and updated component concentrations are returned to each cell.

       Version 1.0 1999/07/28 - Initial release

<b>DATA REQUIREMENTS</b>
       A conceptual model of the geometry and boundaries of the region to
       be simulated is of prime importance.  Initial conditions in terms of
       pressure heads or moisture contents for flow simulations and
       concentrations or temperatures for transport simulations are needed.
       Hydraulic and transport properties of the porous media are also
       required.  These values can be different for different sediments.
       Flow simulations require values for saturated hydraulic conductivity
       and for relative hydraulic conductivity and moisture content as
       functions of pressure head.  Solute transport simulations require
       values for dispersivity and molecular diffusion.  Energy transport
       simulations require values for heat capacities of water and soil and
       thermal conductivity.  Solute transport simulations require a Phreeqc
       data file and a Phreeqc input file, which can be created with the
       PhreeqcI software package (Charlton and Parkhurst, 2002;
       https://wwwbrr.cr.usgs.gov/projects/GWC_coupled/phreeqc/).
       Other information may be needed, depending on
       the program options that are selected.

<b>OUTPUT OPTIONS</b>
       Simulation results can be displayed as contours of pressure head,
       moisture content, saturation, concentration or temperature, and
       velocity or flux for each time step, thus creating a simple
       animation.  The graphical displays may be printed or saved as bitmap
       files.  Text (or ASCII) output can be obtained for pressure head,
       total head, volumetric moisture content, saturations, velocities,
       and solute concentrations or temperatures.  Time histories and
       spatial profiles of the data can be obtained.  In addition, the user
       may opt to view time histories of up to 72 mass balance parameters.

<b>SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</b>
       The VS2DRTI software package was developed using a combination of
       Java, C, and Fortran programming languages.  This software has run
       successfully on the following operating systems:  Microsoft Windows
       7, XP, 2000, 98, and NT 4.0.
       For other computer platforms, the usability of VS2DRTI
       depends on the availability of a Java Development Kit for that
       platform, and the ability to compile Fortran and C programs into
       dynamic or shared libraries that can be used by the Java program.
       Additional information on computer requirements can be found in the
       README file distributed with the software.
